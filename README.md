📱 The SMS Spam Detector application employs logistic regression, a powerful machine learning algorithm, to categorize incoming text messages as either spam or non-spam (ham).

🎨 The user-friendly interface, crafted with Tkinter, ensures a seamless and pleasant experience for users to effortlessly input text messages.

🤖 The logistic regression model has been trained on a labeled dataset, learning intricate patterns that distinguish between spam and legitimate messages.

🚀 Upon submitting a message through the application, the model swiftly predicts its spam status, providing users with quick insights into the nature of their messages.

⚠️ If a message is classified as spam, a warning message is displayed, empowering users to efficiently identify and filter out potential spam messages.

💡 This intuitive and accessible tool serves as a robust solution for users seeking to enhance their SMS communication experience by avoiding unwanted and potentially harmful content.
